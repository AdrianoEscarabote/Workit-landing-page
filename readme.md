## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JavaScript framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### Continued development

This is my first project using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, and I'm excited to learn more about these two frameworks. Since this is my first project, I decided to keep it simple so that I can focus on learning without getting too overwhelmed. However, I plan to tackle more complex projects in the near future.
